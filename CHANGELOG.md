# CHANGELOG

### September 7, 2022
- Attempt to make shuffle algorithm stronger by generating 5 candidate groupings and then choosing the least-common of these groupings based on the stats
- Show solo groupings in the stats

### September 4, 2022
- Write unit tests for Pairer::Board#shuffle and #stats
- Fix bug where recently re-shuffled groups were being included in the stats
- Ensure the position of locked people in existing groups are preserved across shuffle
- Improve shuffling algorithm by shuffling 3 times, like a card dealer we shuffle a few times to improve the shuffle

### Aug 31, 2022
- Add namespace/prefix for session variables to avoid conflicts
- Rename org_name --> org_id
  * Organization Name --> Organization ID
  * Pairer.allowed_org_names --> Pairer.allowed_org_ids
  * pairer_boards.org_name --> pairer_boards.org_id
  * To upgrade from a previous version, add the following to your `config/initializers/pairer.rb`
    * `require Pairer.root.join("app/models/pairer/board"); ActiveRecord::Migration.new.rename_column(:pairer_boards, :org_name, :org_id) if Pairer::Board.column_names.include?("org_name")`
- Style improvements
- Add another button for "Add Group" below group list for more intuitive feel

### Aug 30, 2022
- Style improvements
- Hide person/role delete buttons within the groups section
- Remove data-confirm on group delete/sweep
- Change group delete icon to a broom/sweep icon
- Ensure stats do not contain bogus entries caused by re-shuffling, groups created less than 1 minute ago are deleted upon shuffle
- Extract sessions actions from MainController to SessionsController
- Rename MainController to BoardsController
- Remove "View Password" button, can use the view password feature within "Change Password" instead

### Aug 24, 2022
- Initial Release
